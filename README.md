## Game Description

<b>What is the main action in the game?</b>

The main action of the game is collecting coins to reveal the cone, which will take the player to the next level, while they try to stay alive by avoiding obstacles and running from enemies. The player is able to move around and jump, and as this is a platformer will require jumping on objects with the right accuracy to advance further. 

<b>What was the hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal?</b>

Creating the settings menu was the hardest part of the game to get working. Creating the menu itself was very easy, very similar to how I created the main menu with a custom widget. However actually adding settings into that menu that actually changed the game in some way was something I really struggled with. Eventually, I found a complicated way of muting the music, involving a sound mix. 

<b>What is the most interesting part of the game?</b>

The most interesting part of the game was working with the blueprints, especially when it came to making certain objects and gameplay features react to actions being taken in the game world. This includes physical contact with red boxes and enemies causing the health bar to decrease, collecting a certain amount of coins in a level revealing the exit level cone, and coming in contact with the cone causing the player to be taken to the next level.
